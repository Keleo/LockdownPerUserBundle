# LockdownPerUser Bundle

A Kimai plugin that allows to set the lockdown period per user.

### Copy files

Extract the ZIP file and upload the included directory and all files to your Kimai installation to the new directory:  
`var/plugins/LockdownPerUserBundle/`

The file structure needs to be like this afterwards:

### Clear cache

After uploading the files, Kimai needs to know about the new plugin. It will be found, once the cache was re-built:

```bash
cd kimai/
bin/console kimai:reload --env=prod
```
